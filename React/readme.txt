how react actully work?
react virtual DOM webpage contains html codes

without react complete hirerchy reload and take same amount of time
so it consume most of the time
then react come in picture and it create vitual copy of hirerchy 

Each time you make a change in the code. DOM will be completly updated and rewritten .
this is an expensive operation and consumes lots of time
react provide this solution

the react core syntax is jsx-combination of html and js
const element = <h1>Hello!</h1>;

code will be translated into normal js by BABEL
